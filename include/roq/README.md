# ARE YOU LOOKING FOR MISSING HEADER FILES ?

Many of the header files are auto-generated and only available **after** the
project has been built.

You can browse the auto-generation **schemas** for C++ [here](../../schema/cpp/)
and FlatBuffers [here](../../schema/fbs/).

You can browse the online **documentation**
[here](https://roq-trading.com/docs/reference/cpp/roq-api/).
