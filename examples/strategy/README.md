# Strategy

The example is fairly trivial.
Intention is to show what event handlers are available.
Running the program will log every event to the console.

## Executing

./example-strategy --local-address /var/tmp/xyz

## Debugging

libtool --mode=execute gdb --args ./example-strategy --local-address /var/tmp/xyz

for further details.
